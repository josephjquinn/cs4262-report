    "ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT IDEAS TO TRY:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BETTER EMBEDDING MODELS:\n",
    "   - all-MiniLM-L12-v2: Faster, slightly worse quality\n",
    "   - paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2: Specifically trained for semantic similarity\n",
    "   - all-distilroberta-v1: Good balance of speed/quality\n",
    "   - sentence-t5-large: Larger model, better quality (slower)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. RULE-SPECIFIC APPROACHES:\n",
    "   Since test has unseen rules, consider:\n",
    "   - Train separate models per rule (if enough samples)\n",
    "   - Use rule embeddings as features more heavily\n",
    "   - Compute similarity between new rules and training rules\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. DATA AUGMENTATION:\n",
    "   - Paraphrase training examples using LLMs\n",
    "   - Back-translation augmentation\n",
    "   - Mix positive/negative examples with noise\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. ITERATIVE PSEUDO-LABELING:\n",
    "   - Start with high confidence (0.95+)\n",
    "   - Retrain and gradually lower threshold\n",
    "   - Multiple iterations\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. STACKING (Meta-Learning):\n",
    "   - Train multiple base models\n",
